- Background color: Very light purple (#F5F3FF), almost white, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A soft pink (#F7D0F7), as it's analogous to the light purple but shifted towards red in hue, and different in brightness and saturation to contrast well.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern and accessible interface for the select dropdown.
- Center the select dropdown for a simple, focused user experience.
